# official-app

Apps Purpose: As the goal of the BlockchainUniversityEDU is to make the learning of blockchain technology accessible to everyone, we are developing and releasing an app that can make all of this information available at your fingertips. If you'd like to contribute to the development of this application, please send us an email at blockchaintmu@gmail.com

To setup the official app for development on both Mac & PC for Android/iOS development, follow these instructions:

- Download the Flutter SDK via this link: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
  
- Download Android Studio (link: https://developer.android.com/studio)
  
- Install the Flutter and Dart plugin(s) via opening Android Studio, going to 'SDK Manager', scrolling down to 'Flutter' and clicking on the path directory to the extracted folder of the Flutter SDK that was downloaded
  
- Create a new project once the SDK has been directed, and proceed to head to add an AVD or connect your own smartphone for optimal app testing
  
- In order to test the app on an iOS, simply download the XCode program via App Store on your Macbook. Once the download has been finished, head inside your app project, go to the '/ios' directory, and open the Runner.xcodeproj file using XCode, you will have to download the iOS emulator before testing things out by pressing the Play button on the top left corner
